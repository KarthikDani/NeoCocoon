Causes of Low Birth Weight:

Much of a baby's weight is gained during the last weeks of pregnancy. Pre mature birth causes Low birth weight

Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). This occurs when a baby does not grow well during pregnancy

Consequences of Low Birth weight:

Low oxygen levels at birth

Trouble staying warm

Trouble feeding and gaining weight

Infection

Breathing problems and immature lungs (infant respiratory distress syndrome)

Nervous system problems, such as bleeding inside the brain (intraventricular hemorrhage)

Digestive problems, such as serious inflammation of the intestines (necrotizing enterocolitis)

Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)

Treatment for low birth weight often includes:

Care in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)

Temperature-controlled bed

Special feedings. Sometimes these are given through a tube into the stomach if a baby cannot suck. Or they are given through an IV (intravenous) line.

The existing approaches for jaundice detection involve invasive procedures such as blood sample collection, which can inflict pain and distress on the patient, and may give rise to additional complications. Alternatively, a non-invasive method using image-processing techniques and implementing kNN, Random Forest, and XGBoost machine learning algorithms as a classifier can be employed to diagnose jaundice, necessitating a comprehensive database of infant images to achieve a diagnosis with high accuracy. This data article presents the NJN collection, a repository of newborn images encompassing diverse birthweights and skin tones, spanning an age range of 2 to 8 days. The dataset is accompanied by an Excel sheet file in CSV format containing the RGB and YCrCb channel values, as well as the status of each sample.

	abstract = {Jaundice or Hyperbilirubinemia is a very common condition that affects newborns in their first few weeks of life. The main cause of jaundice is the high level of the bilirubin substance in the blood. As bilirubin is toxic to brain cells, acute bilirubin encephalopathy can occur in cases of extreme jaundice. This condition can result in brain trauma and lead to kernicterus, which causes repetitive and uncontrolled movements, a permanent upward look, and hearing loss. Thus, a timely diagnosis and treatment can help in preventing long-term damage. In this paper, a developed system based on a digital camera was proposed to diagnose and treat jaundice in newborns. The system detects jaundice and determines if the neonate needs treatment based on the analysis obtained from the real-time captured images. The treatment was achieved by using an Arduino Uno microcontroller to drive phototherapy lighting, which has proven to be an efficient treatment method for jaundice. In addition, the proposed system has the ability to send the diagnostic results to the mobile phone of the care provider. The obtained results from 20 infants inside the intensive care unit showed that the proposed system was accurate in terms of detecting jaundice, easy to implement, and affordable.},

Special care is essential to support their growth and development, including maintaining optimal temperature, humidity, and oxygen levels similar to those experienced in the mother's womb. Baby incubators play a crucial role in providing these conditions. This study aims to develop a convenient monitoring tool for midwives and healthcare workers responsible for multiple baby incubators. The tool operates independently and is compatible with various brands of baby incubators. Leveraging an IoT system, it utilizes ESP32 and Raspberry Pi Zero W modules for data transmission. The tool incorporates a DS18B20 sensor for monitoring skin temperature and a DHT22 sensor for monitoring the temperature inside the incubator chamber. Using a pre-experimental design with an after-only research design, the tool's measurements are compared against an incubator analyzer. The study reveals that the developed module still exhibits some measurement errors.

A study of error detection capabilities for random independent bit errors and burst errors reveals that the XOR, two’s complement addition, and Adler checksums are suboptimal for typical network use. Instead, one’s complement addition should be used for networks willing to sacrifice error detection effectiveness to reduce computational cost, the Fletcher checksum should be used for networks looking for a balance between error detection and computational cost, and CRCs should be used for networks willing to pay a higher computational cost for significantly improved error detection.},

The results of this study from the suitability test obtained a maximum error of 0.2\% in the fuzzy control and 0.6\% in the On-Off control.  The average rise time difference for the two controls was 13.53 Seconds. The average settling time difference is 130.46 seconds. The results of this study can be concluded that the Fuzzy System is better than the On / Off system so the Fuzzy system is more suitable for thermometer calibration media.},

Focuses on using infrared human body temperature sensor  to convert the human body's infrared into voltage signal.

Experimental results show the error of the temperature is less than 0.2 C, the measurement time is about 4 seconds with the non-contact infrared thermometer.

Mercury thermometer must contact with the human body , and temperature measurement process need lasted 5 to 10 minutes
easy to read wrong due to external light and other factors
Principle of IR Temperature measurement:

If temperature of object is higher than absolute zero, EM waves radiate due to thermal motion of the molecules

A is a radiation degree, the unit is W/m3 ; αis the Stephen Pozman constant, T2 is the absolute temperature of the object, the unit is K; T1 is the ambient temperature, the unit is K

Takeaways:

All real objects (including the surface of the human body ), β values are less than 1.0

Main radiation infrared wavelength of the human body is 9 {\textasciitilde} 10μm

Light in the range of 9 to 10μm is not absorbed by air, the surface temperature of the human body can be determined by infrared energy

Despite their widespread adoption in a range of settings, there remain questions about their accuracy under varying conditions. This systematic review sought to critically evaluate the performance of NCITs and IRT in body temperature monitoring, synthesizing evidence from a total of 72 unique settings from 32 studies. The studies incorporated in our review ranged from climate-controlled room investigations to clinical applications. Our primary findings showed that NCITs and IRT can provide accurate and reliable body temperature measurements in specific settings and conditions. We revealed that while both NCITs and IRT displayed a consistent positive correlation with conventional, contact-based temperature measurement tools, NCITs demonstrated slightly superior accuracy over IRT. A total of 29 of 50 settings from NCIT studies and 4 of 22 settings from IRT studies achieved accuracy levels within a range of ±0.3 °C. Furthermore, we found that several factors influenced the performance of these devices. These included the measurement location, the type of sensor, the reference and tool, individual physiological attributes, and the surrounding environmental conditions. Our research underscores the critical need for further studies in this area to refine our understanding of these influential factors and to develop standardized guidelines for the use of NCITs and IRT.},

The review included 21 studies showing that measurement bias can range from minor ({\textless}0.5°C) to significant ({\textgreater}0.5°C), depending on the setup


Takeaways:


Setup variables significantly influence temperature readings from contact sensors. Consistent reporting of these variables is essential for accurate interpretation and comparison across studies

Helps to decide whether to pick Resistive Touch screen or Capacitive Touch screen

The touchscreen enables the user to interact directly with what is displayed, rather than using a mouse, touchpad, or other such devices (other than a stylus, which is optional for most modern touchscreens)
Resistive Touch screen:

Resistive touch screen is made up of several layers i.e. (resistive layers and protective layers) with a conductive gap in between.




It works on the same concept of potentiometer .we apply voltage at the two terminals of the potentiometer and then analog voltage corresponding to the length is sensed by the jack in a potentiometer.


Position of pressure is read when two layers become connected at a point, where the panel behaves as voltage divider at touched point


Capacitive touch screen:


Highly accurate and low response time


made up of only one insulating layer like glass, and inside it there is a conductive film present which is used to detect the touch.


Detects based on change in screen’s electric field.


Takeaway:
Since capacitive touch screen has characteristic to detect only human touch or any conductive body. While resistive touch screen can detect any touch whether it is conductive or non-conductive. It is safer to consider to use a capacitive touch screen.
