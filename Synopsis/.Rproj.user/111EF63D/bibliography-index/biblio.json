This has typically involved expensive and imposing machines, to track physiological metrics such as heart rate, respiration rate, temperature, blood oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and ion concentrations. However, in the past couple of decades, research advancements have propelled a world of soft, wearable, and non-invasive systems to supersede current practices. This paper summarizes the latest advancements in neonatal wearable systems and the different approaches to each branch of physiological monitoring, with an emphasis on smart skin-interfaced wearables. Weaknesses and shortfalls are also addressed, with some guidelines provided to help drive the further research needed.",

The existing approaches for jaundice detection involve invasive procedures such as blood sample collection, which can inflict pain and distress on the patient, and may give rise to additional complications. Alternatively, a non-invasive method using image-processing techniques and implementing kNN, Random Forest, and XGBoost machine learning algorithms as a classifier can be employed to diagnose jaundice, necessitating a comprehensive database of infant images to achieve a diagnosis with high accuracy. This data article presents the NJN collection, a repository of newborn images encompassing diverse birthweights and skin tones, spanning an age range of 2 to 8 days. The dataset is accompanied by an Excel sheet file in CSV format containing the RGB and YCrCb channel values, as well as the status of each sample. The dataset and associated resources are openly accessible at Zenodo website. Moreover, the Python code for data testing utilizing various AI techniques is provided. Consequently, this article offers an unparalleled resource for AI researchers, enabling them to train their AI systems and develop algorithms that can assist neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) healthcare specialists in monitoring neonates while facilitating the fast, real-time, non-invasive, and accurate diagnosis of jaundice.",

            "abstract": "Jaundice or Hyperbilirubinemia is a very common condition that affects newborns in their first few weeks of life. The main cause of jaundice is the high level of the bilirubin substance in the blood. As bilirubin is toxic to brain cells, acute bilirubin encephalopathy can occur in cases of extreme jaundice. This condition can result in brain trauma and lead to kernicterus, which causes repetitive and uncontrolled movements, a permanent upward look, and hearing loss. Thus, a timely diagnosis and treatment can help in preventing long-term damage. In this paper, a developed system based on a digital camera was proposed to diagnose and treat jaundice in newborns. The system detects jaundice and determines if the neonate needs treatment based on the analysis obtained from the real-time captured images. The treatment was achieved by using an Arduino Uno microcontroller to drive phototherapy lighting, which has proven to be an efficient treatment method for jaundice. In addition, the proposed system has the ability to send the diagnostic results to the mobile phone of the care provider. The obtained results from 20 infants inside the intensive care unit showed that the proposed system was accurate in terms of detecting jaundice, easy to implement, and affordable.",

Proven solutions remain underused, especially in low-income countries. Transcutaneous Bilirubin (TcB), which is a non-invasive test for the detection of jaundice. Contemporary phototherapy was discovered in England when it was noticed that the skin of babies who were exposed to sunlight on a daily basis was less jaundiced than unexposed ones. Bilirubin absorbs light most significantly in the blue region of the spectrum (near 460 nm). This Light absorption by dermal and subcutaneous bilirubin causes a fraction of the pigment to undergo a series of photochemical reactions, each of which occurs at a different rate. Intensity and wavelengths of used light have a significant impact on the rate of bilirubin photoproducts development. Most efficient light source for treating hyperbilirubinemia is one that emits light in the 460 to 490 nm range of the spectrum (blue) the camera was fitted at 30 cm away from the subject, at an angle of 45 degrees and under ambient lighting conditions of 200 lux, Color transformation and Otsu thresholding techniques to detect the skin in the captured images.

Special care is essential to support their growth and development, including maintaining optimal temperature, humidity, and oxygen levels similar to those experienced in the mother’s womb. Baby incubators play a crucial role in providing these conditions. This study aims to develop a convenient monitoring tool for midwives and healthcare workers responsible for multiple baby incubators. The tool operates independently and is compatible with various brands of baby incubators. Leveraging an IoT system, it utilizes ESP32 and Raspberry Pi Zero W modules for data transmission. The tool incorporates a DS18B20 sensor for monitoring skin temperature and a DHT22 sensor for monitoring the temperature inside the incubator chamber. Using a pre-experimental design with an after-only research design, the tool’s measurements are compared against an incubator analyzer. The study reveals that the developed module still exhibits some measurement errors. However, despite these limitations, the research is expected to greatly assist medical personnel in simultaneously monitoring multiple baby incubators.

However, design decisions about which checksum to use are difficult because of a lack of information about the relative effectiveness of available options. We study the error detection effectiveness of the following commonly used checksum computations: exclusive or (XOR), two’s complement addition, one’s complement addition, Fletcher checksum, Adler checksum, and cyclic redundancy codes (CRCs). A study of error detection capabilities for random independent bit errors and burst errors reveals that the XOR, two’s complement addition, and Adler checksums are suboptimal for typical network use. Instead, one’s complement addition should be used for networks willing to sacrifice error detection effectiveness to reduce computational cost, the Fletcher checksum should be used for networks looking for a balance between error detection and computational cost, and CRCs should be used for networks willing to pay a higher computational cost for significantly improved error detection.",

            "abstract": "A thermometer is a medical device used to measure body temperature. To maintain the accuracy of the thermometer measurement results, periodic calibration is required. Calibration is an activity to determine the conventional correctness of the indicator values of measuring instruments and measuring materials by comparing them with measurement standards that can be traced to national and international standards for units of measure and/or international and certified reference materials. Based on the results of the identification of chronological problems that have been observed, a body thermometer that measures body temperature is needed so and a calibrator is needed to maintain the accuracy of the thermometer. The purpose of this study was to analyze the Temperature Stability and Accuracy of the Body Thermometer Calibrator Based on on-Off Control and Fuzzy Logic Control. The contribution of this research to this tool will use the development of a fuzzy logic control method to produce temperature stability in the Body Thermometer Calibrator (Digital). The method used in this study used fuzzy control and on-off control. The results of this study from the suitability test obtained a maximum error of 0.2% in the fuzzy control and 0.6% in the On-Off control.  The average rise time difference for the two controls was 13.53 Seconds. The average settling time difference is 130.46 seconds. The results of this study can be concluded that the Fuzzy System is better than the On / Off system so the Fuzzy system is more suitable for thermometer calibration media.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, non-contact infrared thermometers (NCITs) and infrared thermography (IRT) have gained prominence as convenient, non-invasive tools for human body temperature measurement. Despite their widespread adoption in a range of settings, there remain questions about their accuracy under varying conditions. This systematic review sought to critically evaluate the performance of NCITs and IRT in body temperature monitoring, synthesizing evidence from a total of 72 unique settings from 32 studies. The studies incorporated in our review ranged from climate-controlled room investigations to clinical applications. Our primary findings showed that NCITs and IRT can provide accurate and reliable body temperature measurements in specific settings and conditions. We revealed that while both NCITs and IRT displayed a consistent positive correlation with conventional, contact-based temperature measurement tools, NCITs demonstrated slightly superior accuracy over IRT. A total of 29 of 50 settings from NCIT studies and 4 of 22 settings from IRT studies achieved accuracy levels within a range of ±0.3 °C. Furthermore, we found that several factors influenced the performance of these devices. These included the measurement location, the type of sensor, the reference and tool, individual physiological attributes, and the surrounding environmental conditions. Our research underscores the critical need for further studies in this area to refine our understanding of these influential factors and to develop standardized guidelines for the use of NCITs and IRT.",
